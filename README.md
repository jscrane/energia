energia
=======

Energia cores for Arduino-1.5, based on https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/wiki/Arduino-IDE-1.5---3rd-party-Hardware-specification

Clone this into your ~/sketchbook/hardware folder and you will be able
to write Energia programs from within the Arduino IDE.

This project also contains a target for my homebrew boot430 development
board based on work by simpleavr and others at 43oh.com, see http://forum.43oh.com/topic/2962-bit-bang-usb-on-msp430g2452/
